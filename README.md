The Worldwide Vaccine Data dashboard provides a comprehensive look at COVID-19 vaccination efforts globally. It tracks key metrics such as:

Vaccination totals: How many doses have been administered per country.
Population coverage: The percentage of people partially or fully vaccinated in each country.
Vaccine types: The different vaccines being used worldwide.
Its primary function is to offer insights into vaccination progress, disparities in vaccine distribution, and global trends. This dataset is useful for analysis, tracking global health efforts, and creating visualizations to communicate vaccination data effectively.
